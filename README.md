# InternetLimited Proxies

[InternetLimited](https://internet.limited/)

These proxies are updated every 10 minutes, sometimes others will update and some will not. This is due to there being no changed in the file and all proxies are the same, but eventually they will update as the proxies from the list are updated and checked.
